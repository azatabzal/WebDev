        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</p>
